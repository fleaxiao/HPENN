# Hierarchical Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for 3D Magnetic Modeling of Medium Frequency Transformers

Hierarchical Physics-Informed Neural Network (HPINN) Framework is a typically designed tool for the 3D Magnetic Modeling of Medium Frequency Transformers (MFTs).

This respository includs all the necessary elements for training, testing, and using HPINN framework.

## Setup
- Open a terminal and change directory to this program folder:
```bash
cd [path-to-folder]
```
- Clone the temperatur conversion repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fleaxiao/Transfromer.git
```
